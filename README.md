# xcancel-redirect
Very simple Android app that redirects X URLs to XCancel

## Setup

1. Use Android Studio to build and install the application on an Android phone.
2. Go to Settings, then Applications; open the XCancel app settings, open-by-default menu,
and tick all the URLs. Note that the app will *not* appear in the app launcher menu.

## Use

Now, any time an app requests to open an X URL, this app opens instead and opens the equivalent
XCancel link.
